# Brag Document
This template is designed to help you keep track of your accomplishments and ensure your hard work is recognized. Often, significant achievements can go unnoticed simply because they aren't well-documented or communicated effectively. A brag document helps you reflect on your work, identify patterns, and provide a comprehensive record of your contributions for performance reviews, promotions, and personal growth.

## Motivation
- Brag documents ensure that all important work is easily visible
- They help both you and your manager remember your key contributions, making it easier for them to advocate for you
- Brag documents also help you reflect on your work, understand what's important to you, and identify areas for improvement
- Additionally, sharing your brag document with your manager and peer reviewers can significantly aid them in providing accurate and thorough feedback, making the performance review process smoother and more effective

## Usage
- Your brag document can also explain your work in more detail; In addition to just listing accomplishments, in your brag document you can write the narrative explaining the big picture of your work
  - Have you been really focused on security?
  - On building your product skills & having really good relationships with your users?
  - On building a strong culture of code review on the team?
- In my brag document, I like to do this by making a section for areas that I’ve been focused on (like “security”) and listing all the work I’ve done in that area there
- This is especially good if you’re working on something fuzzy like “building a stronger culture of code review” where all the individual actions you do towards that might be relatively small and there isn’t a big shiny ship

- In the past I’ve found the brag document useful not just to hype my accomplishments, but also to reflect on the work I’ve done. Some questions it’s helped me with:
  - What work do I feel most proud of?
  - Are there themes in these projects I should be thinking about?
  - What’s the big picture of what I’m working on? (am I working a lot on security? localization?)
  - What do I wish I was doing more / less of?
  - Which of my projects had the effect I wanted, and which didn’t?
  - Why might that have been?
  - What could have gone better with project X?
  - What might I want to do differently next time?

- Many people have told me that it works best for them if they take a few minutes to update their brag document every 2 weeks ago
- For me it actually works better to do a single marathon session every 6 months or every year where I look through everything I did and reflect on it all at once
- Try out different approaches and see what works for you

## Goals for This Year
- List your major goals here to share with your manager & coworkers
- It helps them see how they can support you in accomplishing your goals

## Goals for Next Year
- Start writing down what you think your goals for the next year might be
- Usually useful to do when the current year is nearing its end

## Projects
- For each project, note:
  - Your contributions
    - _Did you come up with the design?_
    - _Which components did you build?_
    - _Was there some useful insight like “we can cut scope and achieve our goals with less work” that you came up with?_
  - The impact of the project
    - _Who was it for?_
    - _Are there numbers you can attach to it? (e.g., Saved X dollars, Improved performance by X%, Used by X internal users daily)_
    - _Did it support some important non-numeric company goal? (e.g., Required to pass an audit, Helped retain an important user)_
- Explain what the results of your work actually were
- Fill in what actually happened a few months after you launched a project

## Collaboration & Mentorship
Examples of things in this category:
- Helping others in an area you’re an expert in (like “other engineers regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS” or “quoting from the C standard at just the right moment”)
- Mentoring interns / helping new team members get started
- Writing really clear emails/meeting notes
- Foundational code that other people built on top of
- Improving monitoring / dashboards / on call
- Any code review that you spent a particularly long time on / that you think was especially important
- Important questions you answered (“helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot of questions related to Y”)
- Mentoring someone on a project (“gave Ben advice from time to time on leading his first big project”)
- Giving an internal talk or workshop

## Design & Documentation
- List design docs & documentation that you worked on
- Examples:
  - Design docs: _I usually just say “wrote design for X” or “reviewed design for X”_
  - Documentation: _Briefly explain the goal behind this documentation (for example “we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it and now we can answer the questions more quickly”)_

## Company Building
- List things you did to help the company overall, not just your project or team
- Some things that go in here:
  - Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting, etc)
  - Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better onboarding materials

## What You Learned
- 

## Outside of Work
