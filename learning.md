# Learning Effectively

## Core Principles
- Learn by doing, not just reading – focus on building projects
- Practice consistently, even if just for short periods daily (consistency > motivation)
- Focus on understanding fundamental concepts (core principles remain, tools change)

## Getting Started
- Start simple to grasp core concepts quickly
- Set small, achievable goals and break larger ones into manageable tasks
- Use version control systems like Git from the beginning

## Learning Strategies
- Explore different topics to find what interests you
- Experiment with various learning resources (videos, interactive platforms, books)
- Embrace debugging as a learning opportunity to deepen understanding
- Dive into low-level programming (e.g., C, Assembly) for deeper computer knowledge

## Staying Motivated
- Pursue interest-driven learning – focus on areas that genuinely excite you
- Contribute to open-source projects to gain experience and learn from others

## For ADHD Learners
- Break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Use interactive learning platforms for immediate feedback
- Try the Pomodoro Technique for focused work sessions
- Find a study buddy or mentor for accountability
